README for iw
=============

iWarp (iw) is a demonstration of server side for controlling i7000
modules via TCP/IP protocol.  To make iw work, you must edit file
/etc/services, give it a un-used service name and port number, for
example

  iwarp		1500/tcp

iw will read this and set it self as service "iwarp" and listen on
port 1500.  If you change the default service name "iwarp", you should
edit file main.c for your new service name

  char *service = "iwarp";
