I-7000/8000 Software for Linux

Please read file README under each subdirectory for more information
if they are there.  This package try to provide convenient functions
for I-7000/8000 modules.  The function calls, there are some created
under Linux, and some wrapped from the I-7000/8000 library for MSDOS.
If you come from Microsoft programming environment and experienced
the I-7000/8000 MS library, the most of the functions can still work
for you.

However, the difference between Linux and Microsoft makes some calls
have different behavior, especially on port open, close, time-out,
and time measurement.  Please refer to the send_read.c example which
show you the basic difference.
