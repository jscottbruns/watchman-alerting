=head1 NAME

rtpsend-pcmu.pl - Send an audio file an RTP session as u-law

=head1 SYNOPSIS

rtpsend-pcmu.pl <filename> <dest_addr> [<dest_port>] [<ttl>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

rtpsend-pcmu.pl sends audio files to an RTP session using PCM u-law (G.711)
payload encoding (RTP payload type 0).
If no port is specified, then port 5004 is assumed.
If no TTL is specified, then a TTL of 2 is assumed.

Each packet sent contains 160 samples of audio, and as payload type 0 has a
fixed sample rate of 8000Hz, each packet has a duration of 20 miliseconds.

rtpsend-pcmu.pl uses the B<'sox'> command as helper to transcode and resample
the audio file to u-law, which means that many audio file formats
are automatically supported (AIFF, WAVE, SUN .au, GSM, ...).

=head1 BUGS

Doesn't keep packet sending timing very well - it goes out of sync very quickly.
